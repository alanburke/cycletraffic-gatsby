M﻿y very first Drupal site - the one the launched my career as a web developer in many ways - was www.athenryac.com. I was getting involved with my local Athletic club, and put my hand up to build a website for an upcoming event. I evaluated a number of platforms such as Mambo and Zend - this was in the days before Wordpress - and landed on Drupal. The initial launch was on Drupal 4.4, and I thought I was just brilliant.

I﻿t grew and grew over the years, and I've upgraded along the way, and time permitting, added features. It was heavily active in terms of contributors, commenters and visitors for a good number of years. But a number of factors lead to a demise of sorts. I wasn't as involved in the club - social media avenues such as Facebook and Whatsapp rose to prominence and the running scene got its own independent sites such as www.runireland.com.

I﻿n truth, it hasn't been maintained properly, neither in terms of backend or frontend development, but more importantly content, in a number of years. I'm not saying all that is going to change, but I will talk about the upgrade to Drupal 10.

I﻿'ve always been a great believer in 'less is more'. Or rather, I became great believer when I realised that everything you add to a system needs to be maintained in the long run. With every iteration of the website in a newer version of Drupal, I always look to see what could be done with just Drupal Core alone, rather that custom code and contributed modules. As a frontend developer at heart, I'm totally fine with building out a new Drupal theme each time.
