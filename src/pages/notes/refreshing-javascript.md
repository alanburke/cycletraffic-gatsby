H﻿aven't done much with this site in a while, but in the grand tradition of giving it an update every couple of years - here we go again.

M﻿y Javascript skills aren't so much rusty, as cobbled together on various projects over the years, so I'm going to work my may through the fantastic [Javascript 30 course](https://javascript30.com/) by Wes Bos. While very little of is brand new to me, its great to get a fresh perspective on things like [Spread Syntax](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_syntax), Arrow functions and other items I've learned to use, primarily by copy pasting, if the truth be told.

I﻿ was a little surprised to see I have gotten Netlify CMS actually up and running last time around - but[ the evidence is there ](/notes/using-netlify-cms):-)
